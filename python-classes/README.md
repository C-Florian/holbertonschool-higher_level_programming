# Python - Classes and Objects

This project is part of the Holberton School Higher Level Programming curriculum.  
It introduces the concept of **Object-Oriented Programming** in Python, focusing on how to define and use classes and objects.

## üìö Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone:

- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected, and private attributes
- What is `self`
- What is a method
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
- How to define and access attributes and methods
- What is the purpose of `getters` and `setters`
- How to define a property using `@property`
- How to raise exceptions with appropriate messages
- What is a docstring and how to write one in a module, class, or method

## üß™ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-square.py` | Defines an empty class `Square`. |
| `1-square.py` | Adds a private attribute `__size`. |
| `2-square.py` | Adds type and value validation for `size`. |
| `3-square.py` | Adds the `area()` method. |
| `4-square.py` | Adds getter and setter for `size` with validation. |
| `5-square.py` | Adds `my_print()` method to print the square with `#`. |
| `6-square.py` | Adds a `position` attribute (tuple) and improves `my_print()` to respect position. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python 3.8
- Each file must be executable and begin with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Each module, class, and method must have a proper docstring

## üöÄ How to Run

To execute any file, run:
```bash
./<filename>.py
