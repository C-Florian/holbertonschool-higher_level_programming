# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This repository contains solutions to tasks from the Holberton School project **"0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary"**.  
The goal of this project is to deepen understanding of advanced data structures in Python, such as sets and dictionaries, and to practice their efficient usage.

##  Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between sets and lists or dictionaries
- Know how to use sets and when to use them
- Learn how to iterate over dictionaries
- Understand common dictionary and set methods
- Use `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` built-in functions

##  Project Structure

Each `.py` file corresponds to a specific task:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-square_matrix_simple.py` | Create a new matrix with the square of each value |
| `1-search_replace.py` | Replace occurrences of an element in a list |
| `2-uniq_add.py` | Sum of unique integers in a list |
| `3-common_elements.py` | Find common elements between two sets |
| `4-only_diff_elements.py` | Find elements only present in one of the two sets |
| `5-number_keys.py` | Count the number of keys in a dictionary |
| `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py` | Print a dictionary sorted by keys |
| `7-update_dictionary.py` | Replace or add key/value in a dictionary |
| `8-simple_delete.py` | Delete a key in a dictionary |
| `9-multiply_by_2.py` | Multiply all dictionary values by 2 |
| `10-best_score.py` | Get key with the highest value in a dictionary |
| `11-multiply_list_map.py` | Multiply each element in a list by a number using `map()` |
| `12-roman_to_int.py` | Convert a Roman numeral to an integer |

>  Note: All scripts are written in Python 3 and follow the PEP 8 style guide.

## Usage

To run a script:
```bash
python3 <filename>.py
